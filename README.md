This website was developed as part of my university community service project. It supports multiple CRUD operations, automated email notifications, and personalized bulk email distribution to all subscribed users.

I was responsible for all software documentation, software testing, and of course, the development of the project.

The following programming languages and technologies were used in its development: PHP, JavaScript, AJAX, HTML, CSS, SQL, and MySQL.
